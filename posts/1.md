<h2>Docker Compose Setup</h2>
<p>
    In this example the Database container is configured through Docker compose <br>
    Make sure to mount a directory that will contain the backups
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        db:
        image: mariadb:10
        restart: always
        volumes:
        - ./data:/var/lib/mysql
        - ./db_backup:/var/mariadb/backup
        - ./config/db:/etc/mysql/conf.d
        environment:
        MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
        MARIADB_DATABASE: my_db
    </code>
</pre>
<h2>Backup Script</h2>
<p>
    Next Lets create a backup script. This script will be somewhat generic and should work on both docker and native
    running instances of MySQL or MariaDB <br>
    The Script assumes the password is stored in MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD envioriment variable, which is common for docker
    setups
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash
        sql_pw=$(printenv MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD)
        backup_dir=/var/mariadb/backup
        # How many days to keep backup for
        keep_for_days=5
        logfile=$backup_dir/backup.log
        backup_file=$backup_dir/full-db-dump-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).sql.gz

        echo "Backup Start" >> $logfile
        #dump DB and compress with gzip
        mysqldump --all-databases -uroot -p$sql_pw | gzip >> $backup_file
        if [ $? == 0 ]; then
        echo "sql backup done" >> $logfile
        else
        echo [error] mysqldump returned error code $? >> $logfile
        exit
        fi
        # Delete old backups
        find $backup_dir -mtime +$keep_for_days -delete
    </code>

</pre>
<p>
    Now we need a script that will execute the backup script in the DB docker container <br>
    seperating the two scritps makes the first more generic and easier to write <br>
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash
        docker cp ./run_backup.sh pg3-db-1:/tmp/run_backup.sh
        docker exec -it pg3-db-1 ./tmp/run_backup.sh
    </code>
</pre>
